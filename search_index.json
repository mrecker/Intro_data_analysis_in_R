It is aimed at individuals with little experience in R/Rstudio and basic statistics. For those who are interested in a general intro to R or a refresher, please have a look at the following site for a great introduction to R/RStudio Introduction to R. Equally, much of the material on statistical data analysis are based on the Statistical Modelling in R workshop. These workshops had been developed by TJ McKinley from the University of Exeter and JJ Valletta (\\(\\dagger\\)). Workshop structure This workshop will loosely be structured into the following themes General introduction to R/RStudio variables and data frames functions and loops basic plotting Data handling and visualisation importing data plotting data with ggplot data wrangling Statistical analysis linear models mixed effect models generalised linear models survivial analysis latent class analysis \\(~\\) The workshop will consist of a mixture between (theoretical) background and hands-on practicals. Specific tasks, designed for you to test your new skills and understanding, are highlighted as Task This task will be explained here The solution can be revealed by clicking Show: Solution Solution A solution will appear here.
